"""LineageRepairBench CONTROLLED track: frozen synthetic cases.

Every case is built from an explicit evidence bundle and labelled **by
construction**: the ground truth is what a careful auditor would conclude from
that evidence, written down independently of ProvenanceLens. Nothing here
calls the decision engine (see :mod:`provenancelens.evaluation.validation`),
and where the conservative policy may plausibly differ from intuition the
label records *why* that expectation was chosen.

The track deliberately covers the situations that matter for repair safety:
strong contradiction, single-source evidence, correlated fields, ambiguity,
tool failures, merge sets, and prose that is not lineage.
